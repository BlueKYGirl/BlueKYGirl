I'm a Tech Elevator Fall 2023 NLR Cohort graduate where I learned Java full-stack development. I have also completed the Data Analysis Pathway through Code Kentucky (now called Code You.) I'm excited to expand my development skills and to build upon the skills I learned through my years as a high-school librarian and school technology leader. When I'm not coding, I'm either outdoors exercising while listening to a true crime podcast or watching streaming TV with my husband and our very spoiled rescue cat, Archie.
